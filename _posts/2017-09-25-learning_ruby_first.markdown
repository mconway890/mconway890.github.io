Six weeks into the Full Stack Web Development online course, and I have a serious love/hate relationship with Ruby. Going into this course I had certain expectations of how quickly I would try and complete the course. I thought as many others have, that if I put in at least forty hours a week, I'd be done in about six months. I had been learning to code for about six months prior to Flatiron, through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> and believe their approach, although very informative, gave me the misconception that coding could be learned at a quick and easy pace. I became very accustomed to their way of teaching. At times it felt like someone was and always would be there, to tell me exactly where and what my errors were, or what I was missing in my code that I stopped fully retaining the information I was learning. Upon starting Ruby with Flatiron, i was given an enormous wake up call as to how much time and energy it really takes in order to learn how to code.

I recently came across an article on <a href="http://www.skilledup.com/articles/4-reasons-learn-ruby-first-programming-language">Skilled up</a>, entitled **4 Reasons Why You Should Learn Ruby As Your First Programming Language** *by Hugh Blen*. The first thing that jumped out at me in this article, was the heading "**Ruby is one of the easier languages to learn**". After weeks of struggling to understand this new and complex language, I started to wonder if perhaps I still wasn't taking the correct approach. It was then that I decided to take a step back from the course and do some research. I began reading blog after blog by fellow coders and their struggle along the way. I started joining study groups and heard countless stories of other students who too wanted to hurl their computer out of the window in frustration. I watched videos that took you step by step through different labs and started viewing documentaries based on the world of programming including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPB_AFK">TPB AFK: The Pirate Bay Away From Keyboard</a> (highly recommend). By briefly taking myself away from the course, I felt a sense of comfort and had a new outlook on this world I truly want to be a part of. 

Learning programming languages happens differently for each individual. Through starting this course, I've discovered the fact that I may need to utilize more than one method of learning. I know that it is okay to take a step back and remind yourself why you entered this world in the first place. I've also realized how eager others are to help and share their knowledge and give their advice. 

Although Ruby is not my best friend yet, I am eager to continue this journey.
