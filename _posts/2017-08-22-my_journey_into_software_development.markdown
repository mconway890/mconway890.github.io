## Back to school...
		
My journey into software development is a very new one. It is something I decided to give a try a day after my 27th birthday in January 2017. For me, school was something I never enjoyed. I detested it so much, that I graduated from high school a year early merely because it was given to me as an option. From there I tried one college and a year in decided to switch to another citing "class size issues" and "harsh professors". The second school I went to was supposed to be a two year community college that I somehow managed to spend nearly three years at all the while switching majors and professors and eventually withdrawing completely. By the end of all my years of education, the only thing I had to show for it was a lot of student debt and even more frustration. The biggest frustration of them all however, was finding a job without a degree. 
	 
Finding a job without a degree is a feat many people struggle with. You could be the most intelligent or qualified individual, but in many cases be passed over immediately by someone who has the higher education even if they don't have the same skills you do. As for myself, without a degree I spent most of my adult years working in retail and child care. The highest level I had gone in these workplaces was "assistant to the assistant to the assistant manager" type job and even then was not given the respect and chances I felt I deserved. It wasn't until I moved for the second time a couple of years later that I heard about this thing called coding. For me the first thing that spiked my interest was the possibility of having a job/career that was respected and not reliant on a university or college degree. The more research I did, the more I discovered this wonderful community of developers and engineers and designers who were able to become successful through coding schools and certificate programs. This is when I decided to give coding a chance and started with a free online school - Codecademy.
	 
The first few days of lessons were very intriguing to say the least. As a beginner, I knew I was only scratching the surface of a world that was so immense and complex that I could not fathom it's capabilities. This feeling of fascination got stronger and at times the complexity of these foreign and abstract languages made me think it best to run for the hills. However, the happiness and pride I felt after solving those first few labs or errors made me realize this was something I could enjoy doing for many years to come.
	 
For the first time in my life I now know what I want my future to look like and am excited for the possibilities. I am eager to see where this new path takes me!
