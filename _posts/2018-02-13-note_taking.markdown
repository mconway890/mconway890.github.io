I recently began the Rails portion of the online Full Stack Web Development course. It was here that I decided in order to retain and better understand the curriculum, more note taking would be necessary. I had taken notes here and there throughout the course but mainly relied on past labs and lessons to help me. This however became frustrating due to the high volume of labs, lessons and videos. The search to find what I was looking for became time consuming and would resolve in reading countless google search results. After starting Rails I realized note taking every few lessons would come in handy due to the great number of commands that rails offers. 

For instance, rails generators and Commands:

According to an article entitled **Attention, Students: Put Your Laptops Away** -- [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away) "research shows that laptops and tablets have a tendency to be distracting..." in addition, "a study has shown that the fact that you have to be slower when you take notes by hand is what makes it more useful in the long run." 

Since I have started note taking I have noticed a higher retention span for what I read and watch. I have found that note taking does not need to be done for every lab or lesson but it does help, especially for areas you struggle to understand or grasp immediately.
